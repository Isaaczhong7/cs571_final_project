For our project, we are handing in our home page, map1, map2, and map3 with its related js code and html file. Also we are included the dataset and the picture asset we used.

Isaac Zhong:<br>
I did all the part of map1 and from html to js code. In addition to code, I have created bar_allergy_data.csv, pie_allergy_data.csv, and total_pollen_score_ranking.csv file to support my visualization. For the library I used D3.js for Data binding + chart; TopoJSON for Map topology parsing; us-atlas for Map dataset. Lastly, the non-obvious features of map1 might be the bar and pie chart showing on map1 because in default the charts are not showing; when user click the specific state, it will show the charts in the bottom of the page where user needs to scroll down to see.
